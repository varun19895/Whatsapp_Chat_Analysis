[2023-10-26, 11:39:00 AM] Roger Mais: - Sentiment Analysis - Multiple Technique
-  
- STREAMLIT

Big model 
- multiple sub-models
- Mutiple column (  title ) these titles this movie falls in horror , Romance 
- ( second model ) Which combines title an review ( title positive. ) body ( negative ) 
- Years — all bad in 1990 , all good in 2022 sentiment of people change for horror 
- This movie is ver good in action but lacked the plot (  neutral ) but you can split the data ( good in action, bad in plot ) 
- Combine 3rd movie ( from TF-IDF word2vec ) based on the 2 model weightage - Nune2 -  negative - but body is positive -  
 - Report for producers an directs would go wrong with the movie NOT UI FOCUS 

- Trend year to year - sentiment 
- Date cleaning 
- Extraction 
- One model ( for midterm )

[2023-11-01, 11:09:34 AM] Roger Mais: so this essentially solves our project
[2023-11-01, 11:10:00 AM] Roger Mais: from training the sentiment model
[2023-11-01, 11:10:22 AM] Roger Mais: to asking queries that returns a dataset based on the sentiment
[2023-11-01, 11:10:45 AM] Roger Mais: “ were customers satisfied with the hotel room size” ?
[2023-11-01, 11:11:55 AM] Roger Mais: we still need to clean an test an get accuracy scores and also compare with other models but looks good 👍🏽
[2023-11-01, 1:19:11 PM] Roger Mais: we also can use PART OF SPEECH tagging to get specific meaning from the review:

In the sentence "the plot of the movie is boring," the words are categorized as follows:

"The" - Article (definite article)
"plot" - Noun (the subject of the sentence)
"of" - Preposition (shows the relationship between "plot" and "the movie")
"the" - Article (definite article)
"movie" - Noun (the object of the prepositional phrase)
"is" - Verb (linking verb, connects the subject "plot" to the predicate)
"boring" - Adjective (describes the subject "plot")
[2023-11-01, 1:19:22 PM] Roger Mais: In the sentence "I found no joy in the plot," the words are categorized as follows:

1. "I" - Pronoun (subject of the sentence)
2. "found" - Verb (past tense of the verb "find")
3. "no" - Determiner (indicates the absence of something)
4. "joy" - Noun (the object of the prepositional phrase)
5. "in" - Preposition (shows the relationship between "joy" and "the plot")
6. "the" - Article (definite article)
7. "plot" - Noun (the object of the prepositional phrase)

So, the part of speech for each word in the sentence is as follows: pronoun, verb, determiner, noun, preposition, article, noun.

[2023-11-02, 9:17:10 AM] Auradee Castro: Thank you Roger! Will watch this one later
[2023-11-02, 9:18:16 AM] Auradee Castro: Hello guys! Good morning! The codes with initial set of text preprocessing is in the main branch, including our new dataset for movie metadata and credits (cast and crew). Kindly pull the changes to your branch and start working on the designated task. Btw, you’re free to correct or add more to the initial preprocessing.

Also you might notice that there are still issues on some records, kindly ignore them. I’m still working on it. They are all marked as TODO.. you can work with sample first to lessen the execution time of the code for testing. 

Don’t forget to commit to your branch, no matter how small the changes are. Let me know for any concerns 🙂 ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-02, 9:24:27 AM] ~ Olivia: Thanks Aura 😀
[2023-11-02, 9:29:44 AM] Auradee Castro: Our professor mentioned that commits are not limited to codes. Documentation, references, etc. can be commited in GitHub as well. So don’t forget to update the reference section for any articles you’ve read. Thank you! 😊
[2023-11-02, 2:54:19 PM] Auradee Castro: I removed some records that were not properly webscraped by the source, hence causing errors when merging dataframes for movie metadata and credits. So download the files from this link instead so that we’ll be using same set of files.

[2023-11-03, 8:41:01 PM] Miraj: hey guys just to confirm, do we need to commit our part onto the main as well or committing it to our branch is enough?
[2023-11-03, 9:21:52 PM] ~ Olivia: As I understand can commit to main aswell but it will be reviewed first before it can be merged
[2023-11-03, 9:22:35 PM] ~ Olivia: But let’s wait for @14372606051 as she is very familiar with this proces
[2023-11-03, 9:22:38 PM] ~ Olivia: S
[2023-11-03, 9:48:27 PM] Auradee Castro: Hi @16479979841! If the code is for testing purpose / not final (meaning you’ll add more to the code), just commit it in your branch. Otherwise, you can create a pull request to move changes to main.
[2023-11-03, 9:49:50 PM] Miraj: Got it. It's mostly on the documentation part for POS (mainly references). So, I'll commit it only to my branch
[2023-11-04, 9:22:41 AM] Auradee Castro: Hello guys, don’t forget to commit any code changes in github, even if it’s not yet final. 

Also DO NOT COMMIT THE DATASET IN GITHUB coz it might cause syncing problem due to its size. Always check the list of files that you’re committing.
[2023-11-05, 10:48:37 AM] Auradee Castro: hi @16478968425 and @919460760368, just a reminder that today is the last day of the week. Kindly commit any code changes or updates /researches you've done for this week. for the research, simply update the references. thank you. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-05, 11:11:46 AM] Auradee Castro: FOR OTHERS: commit all your code changes even if it's not yet final OR you're just comparing codes based from your researches (to check/test which one is better approach) ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-06, 11:31:18 AM] Roger Mais: Anyone finish the ML assignment? Lol
[2023-11-06, 11:31:34 AM] ~ Olivia: Not yet, will do in the afternoon
[2023-11-06, 11:31:41 AM] ~ Olivia: It’s theories only right
[2023-11-06, 11:31:55 AM] ~ Olivia: But weird that need to put in jupyter
[2023-11-06, 11:31:57 AM] Roger Mais: I beleive so, I’m just look at it now lol
[2023-11-06, 11:32:15 AM] Roger Mais: An Social Media exam tomorrow
[2023-11-06, 11:32:20 AM] ~ Olivia: Yes
[2023-11-06, 11:32:57 AM] ~ Olivia: I just read the ppts
[2023-11-06, 11:33:13 AM] ~ Olivia: Quite difficult to memorize 🤣

[2023-11-06, 12:11:44 PM] ~ Olivia: If you are not asleep 💤 haha. Cloudy weather today, snooze mode on 😴
[2023-11-07, 8:00:35 AM] Auradee Castro: hello guys, changes for other text pre-processing (additional regex for cleaning, stopwords removal and lemmatization) are available in main. these are the last part of the process. 
**warning**: lemmatization might take long to execute the codes

for NER, Spellcheck and POS, if you're planning to pull the codes from main, put your codes before these recent changes.
[2023-11-07, 8:20:43 AM] Auradee Castro: FOR TEXT PRE-PROCESSING: we need to complete this by end of thurs. we'll use Friday to solve any merge conflicts, and for any additional code changes. @18762810413 needs the weekend to build and evaluate our initial model. remember that the *presentation is next week, November 15*.
[2023-11-07, 8:22:15 AM] ~ Olivia: Tnanks Aura. Just to confirm no more backlog from my side for the text preprocessing right? 😀 I can try analysing for the next phase which is modelling.
[2023-11-07, 8:24:24 AM] Auradee Castro: yes, we can help Roger on model building.. you can also add some graphs under EDA 🙂
[2023-11-07, 8:24:44 AM] ~ Olivia: Ok sure :)
[2023-11-08, 5:23:25 PM] Auradee Castro: hello guys, can you check if the project board is visible? https://github.com/users/abccastro/projects/1/views/1

kindly check the tasks. let me know if I need to add more to the list.
[2023-11-08, 5:37:27 PM] ~ Olivia: It’s visible @14372606051
[2023-11-08, 5:45:26 PM] Auradee Castro: thanks olivia! :)
[2023-11-08, 5:48:04 PM] Auradee Castro: For model building, it's currently assigned to roger and Varun.. if anyone wants to join the group, please let me know so that I can update the assignee of the task. also if you want to do something from the list, please let me know. The presentation is next week so we need to complete our initial model by Tues.

[2023-11-09, 1:41:34 AM] Varun: Which branch has the latest code now? From where should i pull?
[2023-11-09, 9:07:12 AM] Auradee Castro: hi varun, sorry I missed you message.. pull the changes from dev branch for now. i'll clean the test and prod branches next time
[2023-11-09, 9:07:39 AM] Varun: Alright
[2023-11-09, 9:08:36 AM] Varun: For the text pre processing how much time is the lemmatization takes to complete?
[2023-11-09, 9:08:43 AM] Varun: Approximately?
[2023-11-09, 9:10:22 AM] Auradee Castro: based form my experience, less than two hours ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-09, 9:10:30 AM] Auradee Castro: ‎This message was deleted.
[2023-11-09, 9:11:41 AM] Auradee Castro: but I created placeholder tickets to optimize lemma and NER if ever it takes tooooo long to complete
[2023-11-09, 9:11:55 AM] Varun: I wasn’t able to get much from spell check there were a lot of problems with credits json structure and then parsing it for implementing custom NER. So with a heavy heart i am moving forward now. 😆Will focus on model building from today. Will commit the code for spell check anyways so the effort can be seen
[2023-11-09, 9:12:19 AM] ~ Olivia: That should be fine, we already discussed with Prof yesterday
[2023-11-09, 9:12:46 AM] Auradee Castro: go ahead,  already put your ticket on the blockers hahaha so that it will be reflected as part of the tasks
‎[2023-11-09, 9:13:13 AM] ~ Olivia: ‎GIF omitted
[2023-11-09, 9:13:16 AM] Varun: Ya i saw that. I got like 6 notifications from you😂
[2023-11-09, 9:13:50 AM] Auradee Castro: oooh I didn't know that people get notified. I kept of changing stuff haha sorry for spam
[2023-11-09, 9:14:22 AM] Varun: I need to turn off my email notifications lol
[2023-11-09, 9:15:57 AM] Auradee Castro: sorry hahahaha prof is asking a lot from this project. i'm surprised that he wants us to mimic real world projects 😅
[2023-11-09, 9:18:19 AM] Varun: And he was like you must be doing it already for the capstone😂
[2023-11-09, 9:19:24 AM] Auradee Castro: his standard is so high.. he forgets that it's Lambton college 🙃😂
[2023-11-09, 9:20:02 AM] Varun: Not just Lambton college its Lambton college in Mississauga *
[2023-11-09, 9:20:50 AM] Auradee Castro: oh yeah, need to include Mississauga to be clear haha
[2023-11-09, 9:21:33 AM] ~ Olivia: Did he shared the program yesterday?
[2023-11-09, 9:22:01 AM] ~ Olivia: There’s a part there whereby he said we need to implement else have minus in the marks, i forgot to take notes on which part too lazy yesterday ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-09, 9:22:42 AM] Varun: The orange and blue separation of classes he was showing after feature engineering. That was one
[2023-11-09, 9:22:46 AM] Varun: There was one more
[2023-11-09, 9:22:59 AM] Auradee Castro: ahh the transform_fit and fit.. to prevent data leakage
[2023-11-09, 9:23:11 AM] ~ Olivia: Yeah i think that one
[2023-11-09, 10:15:52 AM] Auradee Castro: @14379839255 you might want to check *docs > research* folder. There are some inputs/suggestions from Roger re model building
[2023-11-09, 10:16:07 AM] Varun: Yes i will

[2023-11-09, 1:19:23 PM] Auradee Castro: better than 4hrs+++ 😂
[2023-11-09, 8:05:44 PM] Auradee Castro: @18762810413 i'm trying to reduce the number of records.. criteria to be considered in dataset
- movie should have at least 100 reviews (with assumption that they are not popular movies)
- movie should be released after 1930 (based from popular streaming platforms)

dataset reduced from 542K to 398K. are you okay with this? this is for the reports.
[2023-11-09, 8:10:15 PM] Roger Mais: Ye that That’s better
[2023-11-09, 8:11:12 PM] Roger Mais: - FastText
- Vader
-Roberta 
- SVM 
- Naive Bayes 

Are the models I’m looking at so far ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-09, 8:11:59 PM] Roger Mais: Some are pre trained an don’t require major preprocessing just punctuation, special character ect.
[2023-11-09, 8:12:19 PM] Roger Mais: They all seem to take the complete review as an input
[2023-11-09, 8:13:30 PM] Roger Mais: Roberta beings pre trained model seems to be the most accurate
[2023-11-09, 8:14:11 PM] Roger Mais: - Vectoring 
- Sentence Transformers 

Used for getting the intent an connections to different reviews
[2023-11-09, 8:21:50 PM] Auradee Castro: ooh.. though we can evaluate different cases and see which one is producing a better model by providing some metrics
[2023-11-09, 8:23:34 PM] Auradee Castro: we haven't incorporated NER yet, so the result might change
[2023-11-09, 8:23:47 PM] Rochan: I did in my branch
[2023-11-09, 8:24:15 PM] Auradee Castro: I mean we haven't combined it with other codes hehe
[2023-11-09, 8:24:23 PM] Rochan: Yeah 😅
[2023-11-09, 8:25:00 PM] Auradee Castro: will check yours and Bhumika's after hehe :)
[2023-11-09, 8:26:09 PM] Roger Mais: I’m basically gonna have to look at charts to see how many positive reviews and  how much weightage is given based on each model
[2023-11-09, 10:20:53 PM] Varun: I am also working on vedar and roberta
[2023-11-09, 10:21:08 PM] Varun: Vader*

[2023-11-10, 9:07:57 AM] Auradee Castro: Thank you Roger.. kindly check the netflix questions @16479979841 as well
[2023-11-10, 9:11:06 AM] Auradee Castro: Btw, guys can we have a meeting later for NLP during capstone class? To discuss abt project updates and process changes. Also if we need clarifications from our professor, he can collate first our questions later before asking him 🙂
[2023-11-10, 9:15:23 AM] Roger Mais: Agreed
[2023-11-10, 9:19:47 AM] ~ Olivia: Professor who Capstone or NLP?
[2023-11-10, 9:36:50 AM] Roger Mais: If we have any question after our NLP meeting we can go to the professor, he teaches in the next classroom ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-10, 10:22:08 AM] Miraj: Thanks Roger. Will have a look at it

[2023-11-11, 10:25:42 AM] Roger Mais: Hey everyone so we have first presentation on Wednesday…. @16479979841  presenting and @14379839255  biulding and trading the Logistic Model …. If you guys need any help don’t hesitate to ask an reach out 👍🏾
[2023-11-11, 10:26:31 AM] Roger Mais: Based on the meeting with the professor I have already started looking at RNN and LSTM models for the final model
[2023-11-11, 10:27:09 AM] Roger Mais: @16478968425 it turns out we were on the right track with creating the data and using an different model for our own sentinel model
[2023-11-11, 10:32:26 AM] Auradee Castro: We can also try using the extracted NER from the reviews when building the sentiment analysis model. What do you think? Unfortunately, it’s still under development..
[2023-11-11, 10:37:36 AM] Roger Mais: Ye provide that as a column possibly …

[2023-11-11, 10:41:45 AM] Auradee Castro: @18762810413 this is the one written on the excel, I put it in docs: https://github.com/abccastro/Movie-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/dev/docs/Project%20Requirements.pdf

technically, almost the same with the PPT but less details. he detailed the tasks in PPT.
[2023-11-11, 10:42:05 AM] Roger Mais: Ok great I just want to make sure we on track
[2023-11-11, 10:42:22 AM] Auradee Castro: i think we're on track for mid term :)
[2023-11-11, 10:46:14 AM] Auradee Castro: thank you roger! you can't escape RNN.. i mentioned abt it yesterday and you said nooooo 😂 but it's good if we can implement it 🙂
[2023-11-11, 10:50:05 AM] Auradee Castro: btw @18762810413, this is the sample NERs that were extracted. it's not extracting properly all the names.. i'll looking for ways to customize it. anyway, can you take look which columns do you think is important in the model? i'm thinking of removing ['ORDINAL', 'CARDINAL', 'PERCENT', 'QUANTITY', 'NORP', 'MONEY', 'LAW'] from the list.
‎[2023-11-11, 10:50:31 AM] Auradee Castro: ner.csv ‎document omitted
[2023-11-11, 10:50:54 AM] Auradee Castro: since you're building a model, you might have a better insight on this one
[2023-11-11, 10:52:15 AM] Roger Mais: This is GREAT
[2023-11-11, 10:52:23 AM] Roger Mais: These are from the reviews?
[2023-11-11, 10:53:29 AM] Auradee Castro: yes, from the reviews. but not all names are being extracted. we'll see if we can improve it.
[2023-11-11, 10:53:49 AM] Auradee Castro: do you want to keep these fields? ['ORDINAL', 'CARDINAL', 'PERCENT', 'QUANTITY', 'NORP', 'MONEY', 'LAW']
[2023-11-11, 10:54:57 AM] Auradee Castro: i found them not useful, but maybe i'm wrong.. hehe
[2023-11-11, 10:55:13 AM] Roger Mais: Ye I think we don’t need them
[2023-11-11, 10:57:52 AM] Auradee Castro: okay.. will let you know once it's available the initial version of extracted NERs.. this might take some time to complete. the execution time takes so long 🥲
[2023-11-11, 11:38:50 AM] Varun: The Review
ace ventura when nature calls in my opinion is a pure gut-buster i laughed really hard when ace jim carrey sang the slinky song imitated jungle animals and mocked the monopoly guy michael reid mackay as a matter of fact i laughed at just about every funny thing he did in addition i have a lot of favorite parts of this movie especially when ace picked up the skunk and said say hello to my stinky friend before i wrap this up i would like to say if you are going to see this movie prepare to laugh until it hurts now in conclusion i highly recommend this gut-busting comedy to those of you who are jim carrey fans or like gut-busting laughs

vader says - Strongly Negative
[2023-11-11, 11:39:16 AM] Varun: better and more fun than the original jungle scenes and a jim carrey as pet detective beware animals

again negative for this one
[2023-11-11, 11:43:13 AM] Roger Mais: Trying using Roberta an see what is says
[2023-11-11, 11:43:58 AM] Roger Mais: Let me check it
‎[2023-11-11, 11:46:48 AM] Roger Mais: ‎image omitted
[2023-11-11, 11:47:22 AM] Roger Mais: @14379839255  Roberta is 96% positive for this one
[2023-11-11, 11:47:37 AM] Varun: yeah! Roberta is way better
[2023-11-11, 11:47:44 AM] Roger Mais: so using Roberta is the way to go to biuld the dataset
[2023-11-11, 11:48:58 AM] ~ Olivia: Wow!!!
[2023-11-11, 2:10:15 PM] Varun: Roberta takes around 1 min to process 50 records
[2023-11-11, 2:10:20 PM] Varun: Do the maths
[2023-11-11, 2:10:40 PM] Varun: For 300k
[2023-11-11, 2:10:42 PM] Varun: 😂
[2023-11-11, 2:41:39 PM] ~ Olivia: just in time to complete running before the submission 🤣
[2023-11-11, 2:42:21 PM] ~ Olivia: More than 4 days

[2023-11-11, 2:47:59 PM] Roger Mais: How long for Vader??
[2023-11-11, 2:48:10 PM] Varun: Couple of minutes 😂
[2023-11-11, 2:48:39 PM] Roger Mais: Yoo running a loop for Roberta?
[2023-11-11, 2:48:47 PM] Roger Mais: Or manually entering
[2023-11-11, 2:48:50 PM] Roger Mais: The reviews?
[2023-11-11, 2:50:09 PM] Varun: I just used a loop on 50 sample records
[2023-11-11, 2:56:13 PM] Roger Mais: Ok
[2023-11-11, 2:56:48 PM] Roger Mais: I don’t think we need to do all 300k maybe 5000/10000
[2023-11-11, 2:56:57 PM] Roger Mais: @14372606051 ?
[2023-11-11, 2:57:06 PM] Roger Mais: Just for the midpoint?
[2023-11-11, 2:57:15 PM] Auradee Castro: We need to separate the code for adding labels. It should be now part of the dataset. We can divide the dataset for each member
‎[2023-11-11, 2:57:31 PM] Varun: ‎image omitted
[2023-11-11, 2:58:07 PM] Roger Mais: Tell me how long it take lol
[2023-11-11, 2:58:34 PM] Roger Mais: Upload the code to your GitHub ( change up some names ect ) an everyone can download an loop a section
[2023-11-11, 2:58:39 PM] Auradee Castro: Is there a way to optimize it? Like running it by batches for multiple threads?
[2023-11-11, 3:03:27 PM] Auradee Castro: Share us the code @14379839255 and will divide the dataset to each member.
[2023-11-11, 3:08:06 PM] Varun: Yes aura give me sometime. I am trying something
[2023-11-11, 5:29:39 PM] Varun: It’s in my local branch now
[2023-11-11, 5:30:21 PM] Varun: Once everything all the rows are labeled i can proceed with logistic regression model
[2023-11-11, 5:34:32 PM] Roger Mais: Your able to do all rows?
[2023-11-11, 5:34:43 PM] Varun: No bro
[2023-11-11, 5:35:25 PM] Varun: I was trying something but didnt work out
[2023-11-11, 5:42:09 PM] Roger Mais: Ok
[2023-11-11, 6:24:36 PM] Auradee Castro: so you run Roberta after initial data pre-processing @14379839255? we can run it even the reviews are not pre-processed right? will they produce same output?
[2023-11-11, 6:25:48 PM] Varun: Yes we can run it before that too. I just ran it before we did stop words removal and lemmatization.
[2023-11-11, 6:46:07 PM] Auradee Castro: okay, will try to extract the code so that will just use py file to run the code
[2023-11-11, 6:46:13 PM] Auradee Castro: thanks! :)
[2023-11-11, 7:00:43 PM] Varun: Np :)
[2023-11-11, 8:24:42 PM] Auradee Castro: hello guys, i couldn't upload the split file to google drive. not sure why. anyway, go to varun's repository, run *split_file.py* then *'Generate Sentiments using Roberta.ipynb'*. 

NOTE: change all file path and filenames before running the codes. 

1. split 1: Auradee

upload the file in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NHVZREe0rBuNrWChQjs4kILsOF2fIVNU

can you guys complete it by morning so that Varun can resume model building? let me know if you have questions. thanks!
[2023-11-11, 8:50:01 PM] Roger Mais: What is the split??
[2023-11-11, 8:50:16 PM] ~ Olivia: Do we have to download and run on local?
‎[2023-11-11, 8:52:29 PM] ~ Olivia: ‎image omitted
[2023-11-11, 8:54:17 PM] Auradee Castro: Varun mentioned that it's long to complete the labelling.. so we need to split the review dataset, and each of us needs run the code for Roberta labelling. it will produce a review dataset with the labels.
[2023-11-11, 8:54:38 PM] Auradee Castro: wait guys trying to check something
[2023-11-11, 8:55:04 PM] Roger Mais: Which rows of the data is my spefice split @14372606051 ?
[2023-11-11, 8:55:11 PM] ~ Olivia: Sure thanks Aura
[2023-11-11, 8:56:26 PM] Auradee Castro: just a minute.. i'm changing the split # of the files and checking something.. coz 100000 records might take more than 1 day to complete 😵‍💫
[2023-11-11, 8:57:01 PM] ~ Olivia: Yes, also when we’re runningwe can still the other tabs of vscode right. Hahaha
[2023-11-11, 8:57:25 PM] Roger Mais: That’s why I was saying earlier
[2023-11-11, 8:57:28 PM] ~ Olivia: Too much on our plate to complete for next week 😀 3 subjects
[2023-11-11, 8:57:33 PM] Roger Mais: Let’s do 5000/10,000
[2023-11-11, 8:57:37 PM] Roger Mais: Just for the midpoint
[2023-11-11, 8:57:49 PM] Roger Mais: An we do the actual data after so we have more time
[2023-11-11, 8:58:06 PM] Roger Mais: I think @14379839255  already did 5000 he can do another 5000
[2023-11-11, 8:58:08 PM] Auradee Castro: but we still need to help Varun on splitting
[2023-11-11, 8:58:30 PM] Auradee Castro: *adding labels i mean
[2023-11-11, 8:58:48 PM] Auradee Castro: we can start as early as now. whatever we complete, that's what we're going to present
[2023-11-11, 8:59:53 PM] Auradee Castro: i think he only tried it for 50 records
[2023-11-11, 9:00:09 PM] ~ Olivia: Perhaps can specify which part of the code needs to be amended before running we can leave overnight
[2023-11-11, 9:02:00 PM] Auradee Castro: i tried on my end as well using varun's code.. 10 records take 9mins. but the list of reviews is simple.. it might take longer for long reviews
[2023-11-11, 9:03:51 PM] ~ Olivia: My gosh 😬
[2023-11-11, 9:47:13 PM] Auradee Castro: ignore this for now. there might be additional code changes.. sorry guys..
[2023-11-11, 9:52:08 PM] Abhishek Natani: No worries aura , will wait for the split
[2023-11-11, 10:16:54 PM] ~ Olivia: No worries @14372606051 thanks for helping on this
[2023-11-11, 10:34:33 PM] Miraj: btw guys there's an assignment for Capstones asynchronous thats due tonight. just a reminder
[2023-11-11, 10:35:05 PM] Roger Mais: Wtf!
[2023-11-11, 10:35:15 PM] Miraj: yeah I just saw it
[2023-11-11, 10:36:14 PM] Varun: Noooooooo
[2023-11-11, 10:36:33 PM] Roger Mais: Sigh doesnt he know that diwali festival is Tomorrow lol
[2023-11-11, 10:36:49 PM] Miraj: exactly 😂
[2023-11-11, 10:41:00 PM] Auradee Castro: hmmm i think asynch and lab2 are just the same, aren't they? so just resubmit whatever we've submitted in lab2 (in week 7) 😂
[2023-11-11, 10:41:32 PM] ~ Olivia: Yes just resubmit the Oct 20 lab
[2023-11-11, 10:42:08 PM] Varun: This college is a joke!
[2023-11-11, 10:42:34 PM] Roger Mais: Seriously?!?

[2023-11-11, 10:43:54 PM] ~ Olivia: The only diff was the instruction last lab was watch week 3 and 4. But the actual video is module 3 and 4. This time the instruction was to watch module 3 and 4. Same link 😀
[2023-11-11, 10:44:27 PM] ~ Olivia: You still have an hour to submit
[2023-11-11, 10:45:19 PM] Varun: So its the same thing only right? Just resubmit?

[2023-11-11, 10:46:15 PM] ~ Olivia: Yes
[2023-11-11, 10:46:17 PM] Varun: 😂😂😂
[2023-11-11, 10:46:21 PM] Varun: Thanksss
[2023-11-11, 10:46:31 PM] ~ Olivia: No worries
[2023-11-12, 1:22:34 AM] Auradee Castro: Hello guys, kindly see the doc for sentiment generating process. 600 assigned files for each person then will merge them afterwards. don't worry, the code is rerunnable and iterates through all files. 😉 the goal is to reduce the impact of a single record failure, preventing it from affecting the entire set of records. all processed old files will be moved to *done* directory, and the files with sentiments in *sentiment* directory. see details in the doc. let me know if you have questions or issues. also if you

[2023-11-12, 8:34:03 AM] Auradee Castro: I forgot to mention, dev branch contains the codes for NER, which takes way LOOOOOOOOONGER (i think 600+mins) to complete.. *for guys doing tasks after data preprocessing*, i extracted the contents of 'movie_name_entities_df' and 'movie_reviews_df' dataframes. you can simply commented out the codes for data preprocessing and import the datasets from https://mylambton.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/NLPandSocialMediaAnalytics/Shared%20Documents/General/Data%20Post%20Preprocessing?csf=1&web=1&e=ohPcGn, then use the same variables.. if you want *to save time.* You call. 🙂 ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-12, 11:15:45 AM] Auradee Castro: Hi guys! Has anyone tried this? Any issues encountered? You might need to install some libraries. just check the error logs. let me know if you have questions. Olivia was able to run it on her local..
@14379886105 @16479979841 @14379839255 @18762810413 @919460760368 @16478968425 

Btw, I was able to complete 600 files out of 1.2K files. Incorporating basic data preprocessing and multithreading made it faster. So approximately within half a day, around 600 files would be completed 🙂 

Also you work on another jupyter file while running this code. So there should be no bottleneck on the sentiment analysis development. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-12, 11:18:04 AM] Varun: Hey Aura, i am so sorry but i wont be able to perform this today. I have work from 11:30 till 8 and then I will be out the whole night for Diwali. 
If some one can please process for my part as well. So sorry.
[2023-11-12, 11:18:30 AM] Varun: And Happy Diwali to everyone 🤗
[2023-11-12, 11:18:49 AM] Varun: @16478968425 was working on it last night as far as i know!!
[2023-11-12, 11:20:57 AM] Auradee Castro: Oooh you should have left it running before going to work hehe anyways, you can do it tom. just let me know for issues.. Happy Diwali! 😊
[2023-11-12, 11:23:32 AM] Varun: I will do it by tomorrow dont worry also the logistic model.
[2023-11-12, 11:23:47 AM] Varun: End of day!😂
[2023-11-12, 11:37:20 AM] ~ Bhumika: Hi Aura.. going to do it now
[2023-11-12, 11:37:32 AM] ~ Bhumika: Happy Diwali 😃

[2023-11-12, 1:11:15 PM] Rochan: I had to make some changes in the code but it is working for me! It takes approx.60-70 seconds for me tk process 1 file
[2023-11-12, 1:11:53 PM] Rochan: I am already done with 500 files out of 600 assigned to me
[2023-11-12, 1:12:09 PM] Rochan: I can run other files too before going to work
[2023-11-12, 1:12:26 PM] ~ Olivia: Mine 163, many to go
[2023-11-12, 1:12:27 PM] Rochan: Just let me know whose portion should i pick 😂😂
[2023-11-12, 1:17:25 PM] Auradee Castro: That’s great! Thanks rochan! You can take either varun or abhishek. You can ask them 😁
[2023-11-12, 1:17:53 PM] Auradee Castro: Btw, zip your sentiments completed under your name then upload it in COMPLETE folder in MS teams
[2023-11-12, 1:18:16 PM] Rochan: My part won’t finish before me leaving for work
[2023-11-12, 1:18:45 PM] Rochan: I will do this after I am back from work
[2023-11-12, 1:19:03 PM] Rochan: Which will be 1-2 am tonight 😅
[2023-11-12, 1:19:46 PM] Auradee Castro: Ahh you’ll just add the files in the folder.. just take varun and/or abhishek 🙂
[2023-11-12, 1:20:48 PM] Auradee Castro: The files are numbered anyway hehe
[2023-11-12, 1:21:25 PM] Auradee Castro: Thank you rochan 😊
[2023-11-12, 1:21:50 PM] Rochan: Nah that won’t work aura bcz your code makes a list of filenames in the directory and then starts the loop! I will have to rerun the code after adding files to the folder!!
[2023-11-12, 1:22:14 PM] Auradee Castro: Oh yeah, forgot abt that hahaha
[2023-11-12, 1:22:21 PM] Rochan: No problem
[2023-11-12, 1:22:38 PM] Rochan: It is managea
[2023-11-12, 1:22:46 PM] Rochan: Manageable*
[2023-11-12, 1:23:23 PM] Auradee Castro: Okay, great! Thanks again rochan! 🙂
[2023-11-12, 1:23:46 PM] Auradee Castro: Will be done by the end of the day 😁
[2023-11-12, 1:24:15 PM] Rochan: Don’t say thanks!! I am anyways contributing so less 😅
[2023-11-12, 1:27:32 PM] Auradee Castro: No worries, you’re able to contribute still despite your schedule 😉

[2023-11-12, 4:09:22 PM] Auradee Castro: yes, it should be faster compared to the initial analysis due to multithreading 🙂
[2023-11-12, 4:10:37 PM] Auradee Castro: i like it, when you added the execution time
[2023-11-12, 4:17:41 PM] Roger Mais: Wow
[2023-11-12, 5:29:09 PM] Roger Mais: @16479979841  how is the document part coming?
[2023-11-12, 6:09:53 PM] Miraj: working on it right now. Can someone help me with a rough flow diagram of the data pipeline for our project? I'll be done with the domain part by tonight.
[2023-11-12, 6:10:20 PM] Roger Mais: I’ll work on this
[2023-11-12, 6:11:01 PM] Miraj: Thanks
[2023-11-12, 6:11:51 PM] Miraj: Also on the coding part is anyone else getting this error when running the "Generate Sentiments using Roberta"?:
OSError: Can't load the configuration of 'cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment'. If you were trying to load it from 'https://huggingface.co/models', make sure you don't have a local directory with the same name. Otherwise, make sure 'cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment' is the correct path to a directory containing a config.json file
[2023-11-12, 6:13:22 PM] ~ Olivia: Hi Miraj, is this related to the csv files
[2023-11-12, 6:14:19 PM] ~ Olivia: Make sure when you extract the file it’s on split_dataset folder and not under your name’s folder
[2023-11-12, 6:14:42 PM] ~ Olivia: I remember i had issue on my first run of this
[2023-11-12, 6:14:43 PM] Miraj: yeah. I'm following Aura's instructions for modeling, running the codes for my split
[2023-11-12, 6:15:28 PM] ~ Olivia: You need to pip install something as well. Let me try to recall
[2023-11-12, 6:15:38 PM] Miraj: Yeah its under the split dataset folder
[2023-11-12, 6:17:13 PM] Miraj: I've installed the tqmd package if that's what you're referring to
[2023-11-12, 6:17:28 PM] Miraj: Still getting the error
[2023-11-12, 6:17:45 PM] ~ Olivia: Hold on trying to check the history in my terminal
[2023-11-12, 6:17:57 PM] Miraj: sure
[2023-11-12, 6:18:15 PM] ~ Olivia: What’s the version of your python?
[2023-11-12, 6:18:31 PM] ~ Olivia: I had to upgrade from 3.8 to 3.10 for this to work
[2023-11-12, 6:19:52 PM] Miraj: its 3.11
[2023-11-12, 6:20:00 PM] ~ Olivia: Oh even higher
[2023-11-12, 6:20:02 PM] ~ Olivia: Hehe
[2023-11-12, 6:20:10 PM] Miraj: yeah😂
[2023-11-12, 6:20:16 PM] Miraj: I'm using docker so
[2023-11-12, 6:20:53 PM] ~ Olivia: python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm --user
[2023-11-12, 6:21:05 PM] ~ Olivia: i executed this, but i think this is for the sentiment part
[2023-11-12, 6:21:25 PM] ~ Olivia: only up to this is the one saved in my terminal history
[2023-11-12, 6:22:13 PM] Rochan: Me too
[2023-11-12, 6:23:02 PM] Miraj: I think I did this already. Let me try again
[2023-11-12, 6:36:43 PM] Miraj: Still not working
[2023-11-12, 6:48:04 PM] ~ Olivia: Hmmm

[2023-11-12, 8:20:08 PM] Auradee Castro: @16479979841 no code changes was done on olivia and bhumika. It should be working fine. split_dataset_directory_path contains all the files from zipped file. Those are the files we need to process. The done directory are for files that were done processing.
[2023-11-12, 8:21:31 PM] Auradee Castro: ‘done’ directory doesn’t have any data from the start. As shown from the code, it will be created if the folder doesn’t exist
[2023-11-12, 8:22:28 PM] Auradee Castro: @16478968425 can i see the sample output of your files later?
[2023-11-12, 8:27:39 PM] Miraj: Yeah I was wondering about how it worked for the others
[2023-11-12, 8:51:37 PM] Auradee Castro: didn't encounter this issue, and i'm not using docker.. trying to search for this error, but they're not helpful.. hmm @16478968425 you're using docker right, did you encounter this error?
[2023-11-12, 9:05:38 PM] Auradee Castro: hi @18762810413 and @919460760368, any updates or progress with the sentiment labelling? no issues encountered?
[2023-11-12, 10:50:50 PM] Rochan: I will share the output once i reach home
[2023-11-12, 10:51:04 PM] Rochan: But i checked in the sentiment folder
[2023-11-12, 10:51:11 PM] Rochan: And files are generating with labels
[2023-11-12, 11:12:08 PM] Roger Mais: I’m just checking it … failed 😞
[2023-11-13, 3:32:32 AM] Rochan: Out of 1800 files (me, varun and abhishek) 1450 are done rest will be done by korning
[2023-11-13, 3:32:37 AM] Rochan: Morning*
[2023-11-13, 3:48:15 AM] ~ Olivia: Mine is done as well 😀
[2023-11-13, 3:49:43 AM] Rochan: Awsome
[2023-11-13, 7:47:05 AM] Auradee Castro: Great! Kindly zip the *sentiment* files and use your name as the filename. Upload it in MS Teams under COMPLETE folder. Btw, are there any review files that weren’t processed due to byte size error? If yes, kindly include them as well. No need to include the files in done folder. Thank you guys! ☺️ 

@6596751777 @16478968425 @14379886105

If it’s okay, kindly upload it before 10am. I still need to merge the files before sending it to Varun for mode building. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-13, 7:52:08 AM] ~ Bhumika: I left it over night but still have 100 files left.. and i have to leave for work rn
[2023-11-13, 7:52:14 AM] ~ Bhumika: I’ll upload it tonight
[2023-11-13, 7:54:55 AM] Auradee Castro: Ooh why it takes longer for you.. What time you’re leaving? Kindly upload what was done, I’ll continue the rest. So zip the whole split_dataset (excluding done folder) then upload it @14379886105 ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-13, 7:59:26 AM] ~ Bhumika: I just left… is it okay if I ask my roomate to send it over at 1pm.. she’s not at home rn
[2023-11-13, 8:00:01 AM] ~ Bhumika: Idk what happened.. 200 files were left when I went to bed but almost all of them were still pending this morning
[2023-11-13, 8:02:34 AM] Auradee Castro: Maybe those files have issues just like mine. Include them when sending the file then I’ll check.. Sure, if it’s okay to her. Thank you @14379886105
[2023-11-13, 8:02:56 AM] ~ Bhumika: Okay sure
[2023-11-13, 8:08:13 AM] Rochan: I will also be able to send around same time!!

[2023-11-13, 8:37:51 AM] Auradee Castro: Btw, @16479979841 you don’t need to do this. I executed your files and they’re all done as well.. The issue you encountered is not common. Might be related to docker. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-14, 2:36:24 AM] Varun: Guys
[2023-11-14, 2:38:25 AM] Varun: I tried to implement multinomial naive baye bernauli naive bayes and logistic regression the highest accuracy i could get was 0.52😅
With some hyperparameter tuning in logistic regression i got 0.56
[2023-11-14, 3:35:51 AM] Varun: So…….we had 5 classes for the roberta_sentiment
Positive
Strongly positive
Neutral
Negative
Strongly negative
[2023-11-14, 3:36:18 AM] Varun: reduced it to only 3 classes positive negative and neutral
[2023-11-14, 3:40:23 AM] Varun: Which helped in increasing the accuracy to 68 percent with logistic regression and 64 with naive bayes
[2023-11-14, 3:40:36 AM] Varun: 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
[2023-11-14, 3:41:12 AM] Rochan: Hang in there champ !! 😅

[2023-11-14, 9:36:55 AM] Varun: Its there in my local
[2023-11-14, 9:37:31 AM] Roger Mais: What did you use as the input for the logistic model?
[2023-11-14, 9:39:04 AM] Varun: Vectorized reviews
[2023-11-14, 9:39:49 AM] Roger Mais: Ok ✅
[2023-11-14, 10:43:04 AM] Auradee Castro: Can you commit your codes @14379839255? I run the codes with NER and it’s complete. We can check if it will improve the model. hopefully the kernel wont restart.
[2023-11-14, 10:43:28 AM] Varun: Already did
[2023-11-14, 10:43:48 AM] Varun: Get it from rochans local he added comments
[2023-11-14, 10:43:59 AM] Rochan: Yeah
[2023-11-14, 10:44:39 AM] Auradee Castro: Okay will check thanks 😊
[2023-11-14, 10:48:48 AM] Auradee Castro: Maybe this is the reason why the model gives us low scores. There are words mixed in negative and neutral reviews that’s supoosed to be positive like ‘good’ ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-14, 10:50:00 AM] Varun: 😵‍💫😵‍💫
[2023-11-14, 10:52:28 AM] Varun: If Film and movie as words are coming up in most of the reviews we can remove them? Becuase it might also confuse the model?
[2023-11-14, 10:58:16 AM] Varun: And this is just on 30k rows. Maybe it will increase when we provide more data to our model
[2023-11-14, 10:59:11 AM] Auradee Castro: There’s a point. We’ll try to remove them later. Will try first with the data after lemma. Did you combine positive and strongly positive, and negative and strongly negative?
[2023-11-14, 10:59:52 AM] Varun: Yeah i did. The accuracy increased by 15 percent after thet
[2023-11-14, 11:00:19 AM] Varun: Oh but i did it directly in my excel
[2023-11-14, 11:00:39 AM] Varun: Replaced strongly positive with positive and same with strongly negative
[2023-11-14, 11:17:15 AM] Auradee Castro: removing the NER improved the model
‎[2023-11-14, 11:17:17 AM] Auradee Castro: ‎image omitted
[2023-11-14, 11:17:35 AM] Varun: Wowww
[2023-11-14, 11:17:44 AM] Varun: What about logistic?
[2023-11-14, 11:18:28 AM] Auradee Castro: I didn't try it coz it's prone to overfitting.. but sure, will run it as well
[2023-11-14, 11:18:44 AM] Roger Mais: Remember Logistic isn’t the final model … as the professor said it’s not very good for what we are doing but the midpoint it just to show we have a pipeline
[2023-11-14, 11:19:47 AM] Auradee Castro: maybe let's just keep the naïve?.. he might think we're not listening to his class is we use logistic regression..
[2023-11-14, 11:20:33 AM] Varun: Yes i know you are going to work on lstm which is obviously going to give more than 90% accuracy, not because the model is effective but you coding is the key
[2023-11-14, 11:20:39 AM] Varun: 😂
[2023-11-14, 11:21:48 AM] Roger Mais: I’m fine with this
[2023-11-14, 11:21:50 AM] Auradee Castro: the NER is not perfect yet still. this might improve if we totally removed all the NERs
[2023-11-14, 11:22:14 AM] Roger Mais: Ye don’t over complicate it  for now
[2023-11-14, 11:22:15 AM] Varun: Sure. Lets stick with Naive then
[2023-11-14, 11:22:40 AM] Varun: What are we gonna show for tuning?
[2023-11-14, 11:22:48 AM] Varun: For mid point
[2023-11-14, 11:23:20 AM] Auradee Castro: i'm about to ask hahaha that can be done if we use gridsearch to check which params is better ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-14, 11:23:49 AM] Varun: Yeah if you see i did it for logistic just need to implement it with naive
[2023-11-14, 11:24:09 AM] Auradee Castro: I don't know how to evaluate and analyze this using graphs, like that our professor has shown to us ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-14, 11:24:35 AM] Varun: My vscode crashed everytime executing the code for hyperparameter tuning.
[2023-11-14, 11:25:24 AM] Auradee Castro: maybe you have a lot of combinations hehe
[2023-11-14, 11:26:26 AM] Varun: Ya i reduced them. I also tried to implement Tf idf which was giving lesser accuracy than count vectorizor
[2023-11-14, 11:27:41 AM] Varun: Also for labeling the target variables into numbers we are using label emcoding but i have heard if the target data is not variable one hot encoding is more useful. Need to check on that not sure right now
[2023-11-14, 11:27:58 AM] Varun: Have read*
[2023-11-14, 11:28:13 AM] Varun: Target data is not ordinal*
[2023-11-14, 4:26:45 PM] Auradee Castro: Hi guys! I’ll set a mtg later at 6pm to finalize the stuff required for mid-point presentation
[2023-11-14, 4:26:59 PM] Roger Mais: Pleas everyone try to make it

[2023-11-15, 5:05:10 PM] ~ Olivia: We do have rating in reviews 🤣
[2023-11-15, 5:05:55 PM] ~ Olivia: If he asked again next time asking why we said no
[2023-11-15, 5:06:21 PM] ~ Olivia: We can just say that we are using that for high level understanding but not included in the sentiment analysis
[2023-11-15, 5:06:36 PM] ~ Olivia: I hope he doesn’t check the dataset
[2023-11-15, 5:08:35 PM] Roger Mais: It’s the movie rating
[2023-11-15, 5:08:39 PM] Roger Mais: Not the reviews
[2023-11-15, 5:08:41 PM] Roger Mais: I believe
[2023-11-15, 5:20:36 PM] Auradee Castro: Actually, there’s a rating on each review. Olivia created a graph for that one so she knows.. just be careful on giving answers guys next time, esp if you’re not sure. 🙂
[2023-11-15, 5:32:12 PM] Roger Mais: There are ratings for each review??????
[2023-11-15, 5:38:09 PM] Auradee Castro: Unfortunately, we have that data hehe
‎[2023-11-15, 5:38:18 PM] Auradee Castro: ‎image omitted

[2023-11-15, 5:38:51 PM] Roger Mais: The “rating” column is the review of the movie????
[2023-11-15, 5:39:06 PM] Roger Mais: That seems to be the movie
[2023-11-15, 5:39:41 PM] Auradee Castro: The filename says otherwise
[2023-11-15, 5:39:52 PM] Roger Mais: What does it say??
[2023-11-15, 5:40:01 PM] Roger Mais: If it was a review rating is usually from 1-5
[2023-11-15, 5:40:03 PM] Roger Mais: Not 8
[2023-11-15, 5:40:04 PM] Auradee Castro: review.csv?
[2023-11-15, 5:40:10 PM] ~ Olivia: Review of the person reviewing for the movie
[2023-11-15, 5:40:35 PM] Roger Mais: Yes review it the movie lol
[2023-11-15, 5:40:47 PM] Roger Mais: For the data
[2023-11-15, 5:40:51 PM] Roger Mais: Have metadata?
[2023-11-15, 5:40:55 PM] Roger Mais: From Kaggle?
[2023-11-15, 5:41:01 PM] Roger Mais: Maybe it specifies
[2023-11-15, 5:42:10 PM] Abhishek Natani: So in short even if it’s confusing what it is and we are not using the rating , let’s ignore it and stick to ‘not having ratings’ let alone be review or movie
[2023-11-15, 5:42:19 PM] Roger Mais: This is usually movie reviews
[2023-11-15, 5:42:25 PM] Roger Mais: 1-10
[2023-11-15, 5:42:33 PM] Roger Mais: 10 being the High movie
[2023-11-15, 5:42:43 PM] Roger Mais: They rated Kill Bill 8/10
[2023-11-15, 5:42:50 PM] Roger Mais: That’s what I’m getting from this
[2023-11-15, 5:42:55 PM] Roger Mais: But correct me if I’m wrong
[2023-11-15, 5:43:00 PM] Abhishek Natani: IGNORE IT ! we ain’t sure to use it in our model no?
[2023-11-15, 5:43:52 PM] Roger Mais: The actual review ratings are usually 1-5 stars
[2023-11-15, 5:44:09 PM] ~ Olivia: Let’s revisit next time
[2023-11-15, 5:44:22 PM] ~ Olivia: For now let’s chill and enjoy the result of today’s presentation 😀
[2023-11-15, 5:44:44 PM] Roger Mais: Ye sure we can’t change it now, lol but I was told we only have movie ratings hence the Roberta idea lol …
[2023-11-15, 5:44:50 PM] Roger Mais: But anyways 😌🤷🏾‍♂️

[2023-11-15, 5:47:45 PM] Auradee Castro: Yep, got nothing to do with it 😅 hopefully, he forgot abt our answer haha
[2023-11-15, 5:48:28 PM] ~ Olivia: roBERTa is still needed 🤣
[2023-11-15, 5:56:03 PM] Abhishek Natani: No! See understand one thing , a review or a comment cannot have a rating. Just look at a rating along with a review is for ‘something’ , can be a movie a product or whichever case. These rating are here for a movie.

A review can have ‘upvotes’ ‘downvotes’ or ‘likes’ ‘dislikes’. A review is nothing but just a COMMENT which can never have ratings. A rating is an addition to review for something, in this case that something is a ‘movie’ 

Roger is right that these ratings are for movies and in no practical world there can be a rating for REVIEW ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-15, 5:58:04 PM] Abhishek Natani: Like if I comment on an Amazon product , my review can have likes 👍 or dislikes 👎 but how can I rate my review? I can only rate that product
[2023-11-15, 6:07:29 PM] Auradee Castro: I think the question was if there’s a rating provided by the viewer that comes with the review. Of course, you won’t rate the review. But you can gauge if the viewer loves/hates the movie based on the rating he provided. Our professor seemed to have a follow up question on this if we said yes.. based from his reaction.
‎[2023-11-15, 6:07:57 PM] ~ Olivia: ‎image omitted
[2023-11-15, 6:08:22 PM] ~ Olivia: I hope this answers the question if it’s movie review or personal movie rating of the person reviewing

[2023-11-15, 6:09:02 PM] ~ Olivia: For 1 movie cloverfield has different ratings ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-15, 6:09:25 PM] Abhishek Natani: Exactly see the last column helpful or not and numbers , that’s for review and rating is for movie
[2023-11-15, 6:20:09 PM] ~ Bhumika: I think Aura is right…. If the reviewer rates the movie 3/10 then there’s no way he would actually leave a positive review right? It’s safe to assume it as negative
[2023-11-15, 6:27:57 PM] Abhishek Natani: Then why NLP , I can feed this data to sql table and take a select statement and make a column sentiment like :
UPDATE reviews
SET sentiment = 'positive'
WHERE ratings >= 6;

UPDATE reviews
SET sentiment = 'negative'
WHERE ratings < 5;

UPDATE reviews
SET sentiment = 'neutral'
WHERE ratings = 5;

And project done. Doesn’t make sense ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-15, 6:29:21 PM] Roger Mais: You can hate a movie an still give a ( positive sentiment )review
[2023-11-15, 6:29:46 PM] Roger Mais: Example - I can give Thor  a 3/10
[2023-11-15, 6:30:20 PM] Roger Mais: But my review is saying «  I love Thors acting , and the VFX an the plot moved well but the movie was a bit long for me « ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-15, 6:30:34 PM] Roger Mais: That generally positive sentiment
[2023-11-15, 6:30:54 PM] Roger Mais: The movie rating doesn’t mean positive or negative sentiment from the review
[2023-11-15, 6:31:08 PM] ~ Olivia: Yes, but prof was just asking if thereis rating
[2023-11-15, 6:31:26 PM] ~ Bhumika: Mhmm yeah.. makes sense
[2023-11-15, 6:31:28 PM] Roger Mais: Ratings for the reviews Oliv
[2023-11-15, 6:31:41 PM] Roger Mais: He was acting what’s the point of using
[2023-11-15, 6:31:46 PM] Roger Mais: Roberta
[2023-11-15, 6:31:51 PM] Roger Mais: If we had this
[2023-11-15, 6:32:01 PM] ~ Olivia: Because we used that for the actual review
[2023-11-15, 6:32:10 PM] Abhishek Natani: Cook food and eat and relax for today please
[2023-11-15, 6:32:14 PM] Roger Mais: Right
[2023-11-15, 6:37:38 PM] Auradee Castro: If the question is abt the importance of roberta.. then yes, we used it to properly get the sentiment of the reviews. Coz bad rating doesn’t necessarily mean bad review. *But the question was if there’s a rating provided by the user together with the review.* then the answer if yes.
[2023-11-15, 6:37:58 PM] Auradee Castro: Anyway, let’s forget about it and enjoy the rest of the day

Just saying..!!
